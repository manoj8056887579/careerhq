    {
      question: "How long does the approval process take?",

    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to be exclusive to Career HQ?",

    },
    {
      question: "How do I submit referrals?",
      answer:
        "Approved partners receive access to our partner portal where they can submit client referrals through a secure online form. All referrals must include genuine client information and consent.",
    },
    {
      question: "What information is considered confidential?",
