                Career HQ started with one goal—to help students dream bigger and
                go further. What began as a small counseling center has evolved
                into a global education and career platform, enabling access to
                world-class academic and professional opportunities.
              </p>
              <p className="text-foreground-600 mb-4">
                We have helped thousands of students pursue international
                education, explore global careers, and build futures without
                borders. Career HQ connects ambitious individuals with leading
                universities and meaningful career pathways worldwide.
              </p>
              <p className="text-foreground-600 mb-6">
                Career HQ is led by Gandhi and Benita, whose vision is rooted in
                real-world experience. Having navigated international education
                and global career transitions themselves, they recognized the
                need for reliable, transparent, and personalized guidance. Their
                leadership has shaped Career HQ into an organization built on
                trust, integrity, and long-term success—focused on empowering
                students and professionals to make confident, informed
                decisions.
              </p>
              <p className="text-foreground-600 mb-4">
                At Career HQ, we don’t just support admission / placement—we
                partner in building futures. Because talent has no boundaries,
                and neither should opportunities.
